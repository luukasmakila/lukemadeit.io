        <h1 className="text-2xl">The Truth About The M4 MacBook Pro - 3 Months Later</h1>
        <p>After Apple unveiled the new M4 MacBook Pro's last year, I instantly thought to myself "ok this year is the year that I finally upgrade my laptop". And after a few months of daily usage for programming and editing, here are my thoughts about it.</p>
        <p>I decided to go with the M4 Max chip with 48GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. I know it's probably little overkill, but I want this machine to last me for many years to come so I didn't mind spending the extra cash.</p>
        <h2 className="text-lg">Screen Size</h2>
        <p>
          Now let's start with the most controversial one when it comes to getting a new laptop... The screen size. I went with the 16'' version, mainly due to wanting more screen real estate for editing. But bigger does not always mean better...
          I didn't really consider the other things I would use the laptop for other than work ex. traveling or even just watching YouTube in my bed at night and for these activities it really does feel like im carrying a brick around.
        </p>
        <p>That said the main point of the Pro models is to deliver elite performance and used as work machines and for editing the 16''' screen truly is a game changer as I can see much more of the timeline.</p>
        <p>If you're someone who wants to get the best of both worlds when it comes to traveling as well as getting work done, then the 14'' MacBook Pro is the way to go. If I didn't make videos then that's what I would also go with.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the display itself, I mean do we even need to talk about it? The MacBook displays are in my opinion the best in the market. I personally prefer the regular glass over the nano texture one, to me the regular glass just feels sharper, which I value for my video editing.</p>
        <h2 className="text-lg">Battery Aging</h2>
        <p>When I consider buying a new laptop another big thing in my mind is the battery performance. As someone who likes to move around while working I often have the laptop unplugged from a power source.</p>
        <p>
          After the 3 months of usage the battery health is still at a 100%, I have kept all my settings on "auto" as I trust Apple when it comes to optimizing the battery usage.
          And after a normal days of usage for programming, while having the laptop completely unplugged from a power source I was able to get around 8 hours of screen time before having to charge it.
          When I only use it for editing work I tend to get around 5-6 hours of screen time.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-lg">Storage</h2>
        <p>A common comment I got on YouTube about the laptop is that 1TB storage wont be enough for me. I store most of my media on external SSD's. And after installing all the apps I use I have only used 163GB of storage.</p>
        <p>I'd even go as far as saying that 512GB would be enough storage for folks who use the laptop just for work purposes and won't store much media or games on the laptop itself. Though I have to say that the bump from 512GB to 1TB isn't too expensive on Apple's standards.</p>
